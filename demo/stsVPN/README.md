## 🚀 Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Android Studio project file.
3. Due to file size limitations, jniLibs are too big to be published on npm. Use the assets on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ccnnde/react-native-simple-openvpn/releases/tag/v2.0.0) instead

   Download and unzip the resources you need for the corresponding architecture, and put them in `android/app/src/main/jniLibs` (create a new `jniLibs` folder if you don't have one)

   ```sh
   project
   ├── android
   │   ├── app
   │   │   └── src
   │   │       └── main
   │   │           └── jniLibs
   │   │               ├── arm64-v8a
   │   │               ├── armeabi-v7a
   │   │               ├── x86
   │   │               └── x86_64
   │   └── ...
   ├── ios
   └── ...
   ```
3. Run the application on your preferred Android device or emulator.

Explore the codebase, experiment with configurations, and use this demo as a foundation for incorporating OpenVPN technology into your Android applications with enhanced internal network connectivity.
